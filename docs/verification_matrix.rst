Verification Matrix
===================

Purpose
-------

This page is the research-facing index of what SPECTRAX-GK treats as verified,
validated, exploratory, or deferred. It is meant to answer four questions for
each lane:

1. what physical model is being exercised,
2. what observable is compared,
3. what the reference is,
4. what acceptance gate applies.

Literature Baselines Reviewed

Status Legend
-------------

- ``Closed``: benchmark lane is accepted for research claims.
- ``Open``: lane is active and expected to close.
- ``Exploratory``: useful for development, not yet a paper claim.
- ``Deferred``: intentionally out of scope for the current paper/release.

     - residual and damping must match literature/code-backed references before publication use; signed ``Phi_zonal_mode_kxt`` is now available. The current artifact is ``docs/_static/miller_zonal_response_pilot.png`` from ``tools/generate_miller_zonal_response_pilot.py`` using Merlo Case-III Table-III parameters, an initial density perturbation, a common pre-recurrence fit window ``t≈30``, separate positive/negative-extrema damping fits, and a Hilbert-phase frequency extraction on that same window. It gives ``residual≈0.192`` against a paper-scale target of about ``0.19``, ``ω_GAM R0 / v_i≈2.20`` against a figure read-off near ``2.24``, and ``γ_GAM R0 / v_i≈-0.176`` against a figure read-off near ``-0.17``. The remaining explicit follow-up item is the later finite-moment recurrence rather than the benchmark-scale Merlo gate

Frozen artifact paths for the currently closed tokamak linear lanes:

- ``docs/_static/cyclone_comparison.png``
- ``docs/_static/etg_comparison.png``
- ``docs/_static/kbm_comparison.png``
- ``docs/_static/kbm_eigenfunction_overlap_summary.png``
- ``docs/_static/reference_modes/kbm_linear_gx_ky0p3000.npz``
- ``docs/_static/benchmark_core_linear_atlas.png``

Closed raw-overlay diagnostic artifacts for the KBM lane:

- ``docs/_static/reference_modes/kbm_linear_spectrax_ky0p3000.csv``
- ``docs/_static/kbm_eigenfunction_reference_overlay_ky0p3000.png``
- ``docs/_static/reference_modes/kbm_eigenfunction_reference_overlay_ky0p3000.json``
- ``tools/generate_kbm_reference_overlay.py``

The refreshed bounded-cost extraction produces normalized overlap
``0.999985`` and relative ``L^2`` mismatch ``0.00721`` against the frozen GX
raw mode at ``k_y \approx 0.3`` when run with the exact KBM grid contract, the
selected growth-fit window, and a late-time eigenfunction tail window. The
generator writes a machine-readable gate report with ``overlap >= 0.95`` and
``relative L^2 <= 0.25`` as the acceptance policy, and this raw-overlay
artifact now passes.

Branch-followed scan tables should use the same gate-report convention:
observed-order gates for resolution or velocity-space convergence, and
branch-continuity gates for adjacent ``gamma``/``omega`` jumps and successive
eigenfunction overlap when overlap data are available. The tracked KBM
candidate table now has a no-rerun summary path through
``tools/generate_kbm_branch_gate_summary.py`` and
``docs/_static/kbm_branch_gate_summary.json``. That summary now uses the
continuity-first selected branch and passes the strict checks:
``max_rel_gamma_jump ~= 0.388``, ``max_rel_omega_jump ~= 0.320``, and no
successive-overlap deficit.

Observed-order convergence tables should also gate both the asymptotic finest
refinement and the full set of pairwise refinement orders. The generic
``tools/generate_observed_order_gate.py`` path now records this policy in JSON.
The tracked Cyclone velocity-space convergence artifact
``docs/_static/cyclone_resolution_observed_order.json`` is closed on an
office/GPU ``ky=0.30`` time-path sweep with all pairwise orders positive,
final-pair order above ``4.8``, and finest-grid relative growth-rate error
about ``1.1e-3``.

The current materialized gate reports are indexed by
``tools/make_validation_gate_index.py`` in
``docs/_static/validation_gate_index.json`` and
``docs/_static/validation_gate_index.png``. Exploratory diagnostics can set
``gate_index_include=false`` so they remain documented but do not count as
release blockers. The current release-gate index has ``17/17`` tracked reports
passing.

     - a case-specific runtime/tool path exists through ``examples/benchmarks/runtime_w7x_zonal_response_vmec.toml`` and ``tools/generate_w7x_zonal_response_panel.py``. The runtime now supports the paper-facing ``init_field="phi"`` Gaussian potential initializer and writes both the older volume-weighted ``Phi_zonal_mode_kxt`` diagnostic and the W7-X line-average ``Phi_zonal_line_kxt`` observable. The frozen VMEC-backed artifact now lives at ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_response_panel.png`` with metadata in ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_response_panel.json`` and replayable traces in ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_response_panel.traces.csv``; it uses line-first normalization, following the paper text. The stella/GENE Fig. 11 reference traces and inset residuals are digitized by ``tools/digitize_w7x_zonal_reference.py`` into ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_reference_digitized.csv`` and ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_reference_digitized_residuals.csv``. ``tools/compare_w7x_zonal_reference.py`` writes the residual/time-coverage/envelope artifact ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_reference_compare.json`` and can now replay the comparison from the tracked combined trace CSV. ``tools/plot_w7x_zonal_contract_audit.py`` writes ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_contract_audit.png`` as a publication-facing open-lane diagnostic, ``tools/plot_w7x_zonal_moment_tail_audit.py`` writes ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_moment_tail_audit.png`` to track the velocity-space recurrence / moment-tail hypothesis, ``tools/plot_w7x_zonal_closure_ladder.py`` writes ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_closure_ladder_kx070.png`` to compare bounded closure attempts at ``k_x rho_i=0.07``, ``tools/plot_w7x_zonal_state_convention_audit.py`` writes ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_state_convention_audit.png`` to close the initializer/observable convention layer, and ``tools/plot_w7x_zonal_recurrence_sweep.py`` writes ``docs/_static/w7x_zonal_recurrence_sweep_kx070.png`` to separate moment-resolution and closure-source effects. The current SPECTRAX artifact enforces the intended test-4 ``k_x rho_i`` values ``[0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.30]`` with a periodic radial box for the ``k_y=0`` zonal run and reaches ``t≈3460`` for ``k_x rho_i=0.05`` and ``t≈1980`` for the other three wavelengths. Under the paper-facing normalization, residuals fail at ``k_x rho_i=0.07``, ``0.10``, and ``0.30`` and late envelopes fail for all wavelengths. The state-level audit closes the convention question with Gaussian-profile relative ``L2`` error ``1.85e-6`` and helper/manual observable agreement near ``2e-16``. The bounded recurrence sweep shows that ``Nl=12,Nm=48`` has the best no-closure trace error on ``t v_t/a <= 100`` and that constant-source closure suppresses the final Hermite tail but worsens the trace error. The remaining closure step is therefore a physical velocity-space recurrence / damping fix rather than a documentation or normalization change
   * - W7-X fluctuation spectra
     - resolved ``k_y`` spectra, ``k_x``-``k_y`` fluctuation power, and temporal spectra
     - W7-X nonlinear gate plus Doppler-reflectometry comparison conventions
     - Initial simulation diagnostic closed; experimental transfer-function validation deferred
     - ``tools/plot_w7x_fluctuation_spectrum_panel.py`` writes ``docs/_static/w7x_fluctuation_spectrum_panel.png`` with CSV/JSON/PDF companions from the gated W7-X ``t≈200`` nonlinear NetCDF output. The script refuses failed nonlinear gate summaries by default and marks the JSON with ``claim_level = "validated_nonlinear_simulation_spectrum_not_experimental_validation"`` and ``gate_index_include = false``. It therefore closes the reproducible spectrum-estimator layer while leaving density/zonal-frequency comparison through a Doppler-reflectometry transfer function as a future manuscript extension
   * - HSX
     - ``gamma(k_y)``, ``omega(k_y)``
     - GX / internal frozen references
     - Closed
     - near-marginal deviations documented explicitly
   * - Electromagnetic stellarator verification
     - heavy-electron linear/nonlinear EM response
     - GENE-3D verification conventions
     - Open
     - close heavy-electron EM lane before realistic-mass claims

Frozen artifact paths for the currently closed stellarator linear lanes:

- ``docs/_static/w7x_linear_t2_scan.csv``
- ``docs/_static/hsx_linear_t2_scan.csv``
- ``docs/_static/w7x_linear_t2_lastvalue.csv``
- ``docs/_static/hsx_linear_t2_lastvalue.csv``

- ``docs/_static/reference_modes/w7x_eigenfunction_reference_overlay_ky0p3000.json``
- ``docs/_static/benchmark_core_linear_atlas.png``

For W7-X, the whole-window scan and the late-time last-value reduction tell the
same story. For HSX, the whole-window ``mean_rel_gamma`` metric is kept as an
honest near-marginal stress signal, but the late-time closure should be read
from ``docs/_static/hsx_linear_t2_lastvalue.csv`` because the final
``(gamma, omega)`` values are much tighter than the whole-window average.

The W7-X raw eigenfunction overlay is now closed at ``k_y rho_i = 0.3`` using
``tools/generate_w7x_reference_overlay.py``. The frozen GX bundle was refreshed
from the finite ``t≈2`` raw field history because the older bundle source
contained non-finite late-time fields. The matched imported-geometry
SPECTRAX-GK extraction uses the validated ``z_index`` diagnostic contract and
gives normalized overlap ``0.9999999994`` and relative ``L^2`` mismatch
``3.33e-5`` against the frozen GX raw mode.

The summary panel above is generated by
``tools/plot_nonlinear_window_statistics.py`` from the frozen gate-summary JSON
files. It plots the gate statistic (windowed mean relative mismatch) and the
maximum relative mismatch for each diagnostic, excluding exploratory summaries
with ``gate_index_include=false``.

  tightened case gate ``0.095``.

- ``docs/_static/nonlinear_hsx_gate_summary.json``: passed at the tightened
  case gate ``0.05``.
- ``docs/_static/nonlinear_w7x_gate_summary.json``: passed at the current
  ``0.10`` mean-relative release gate after the corrected adaptive state
  continuation and GX-style ``Phi2`` artifact refresh.
- ``docs/_static/nonlinear_cyclone_gate_summary.json``: passed on the mature
  Cyclone ``t=100..400`` transport window at the current ``0.10``
  mean-relative release gate.
- ``docs/_static/nonlinear_cyclone_short_gate_summary.json``: retained only as
  an exploratory ``t=5`` startup/resolved-spectrum audit and excluded from the
  release-gate index.

Quasilinear Diagnostics and Model Selection
-------------------------------------------

The quasilinear verification surface is deliberately split between validated
linear-state diagnostics, rejected absolute-flux calibration attempts, and one
scoped model-selection result. A closed model-selection status must not be read
as a promoted runtime predictor.

     - Closed as diagnostics

       this is not calibrated absolute-flux prediction

     - ``docs/_static/quasilinear_stellarator_train_holdout_report.json`` and
       ``docs/_static/quasilinear_saturation_rule_sweep.json``
     - Rejected / unpromoted
     - current one-constant and simple-rule reports fail the held-out
       absolute-flux gate and must not be exposed as a user-facing saturation
       law
   * - ``spectral_envelope_ridge`` model selection
     - leave-one-geometry-out error and interval coverage
     - ``docs/_static/quasilinear_candidate_uncertainty.json`` and
       ``docs/_static/quasilinear_candidate_regularization_sweep.json`` and
       ``docs/_static/quasilinear_model_selection_status.json``
     - Closed as scoped model-development result / failed promotion gate
     - the expanded 11-case uncertainty/model-selection gate fails because the
       best candidate has mean relative error about ``0.400 > 0.35`` and
       prediction-interval coverage ``9/11``; after adding the QP holdout it
       still fails the strict rank/correlation screening gates, so it
       does not promote a runtime/TOML absolute-flux predictor, universal
       nonlinear transport model, or shipped saturation option
   * - Future absolute-flux promotion
     - calibrated heat-flux prediction on nonlinear holdouts
     - future late-window convergence metadata and promotion JSON
     - Open
     - every holdout needs finite passed post-transient convergence metadata:
       transient cutoff, running-mean drift, block/bootstrap uncertainty,
       finite sample count, and source provenance

These gates do not change the deferred W7-X lanes: W7-X zonal long-window
recurrence/damping and W7-X TEM / kinetic-electron validation remain outside
the current manuscript/release scope. They also do not promote a universal
absolute-flux model. Production nonlinear optimization is promoted only for the
selected optimized-equilibrium audit now attached to the guard; nonlinear
turbulence gradients and broad multi-surface claims remain separate gates.

Autodiff Validation

The single-mode inverse figure is intentionally a sensitivity and
non-identifiability demonstration. The two-mode figure is the closed
parameter-recovery validation. Both examples now write finite-difference
Jacobian checks, Jacobian rank/condition number, covariance, standard
deviations, correlations, and one-sigma UQ ellipse area into their summary
JSON files. Those metadata are part of the validation gate: differentiated
observables are not promoted to inverse-design or UQ claims unless the
derivative check is conditioned and the inverse problem is identifiable.

Differentiable Geometry and Stellarator Objectives
--------------------------------------------------

The VMEC/Boozer objective lane is split into three claim levels. The first two
are currently release/manuscript scoped; the third remains a future promotion
gate.

     - Closed for artifact-passing rows

       current combined maximum relative mismatch is about ``2.7e-2`` after

       ``tools/check_vmec_boozer_aggregate_holdout_gate.py``
     - Closed for VMEC/Boozer held-out plumbing; open for broad production
       nonlinear optimization claims
     - aggregate finite-difference and line-search artifacts pass on the same
       training sample set, and the independent QH production-scope validation
       artifact covers a held-out field-line ``alpha`` with a passed replicated
       nonlinear-window ensemble. Production nonlinear optimization promotion
       still requires three independent optimized-equilibrium ensembles and
       three matched baseline-to-optimized audits, so one converged held-out
       VMEC/Boozer transport window cannot by itself support a broad
       optimized-equilibrium heat-flux claim.
       The multi-alpha finite-difference artifact passes and the growth-vs-QL
       comparison shows objective-dependent descent directions. The
       reduced-portfolio guard now verifies that the multi-alpha rows have real
       VMEC/Boozer provenance, multi-alpha/multi-``k_y`` metadata, finite
       aggregate FD fields, finite growth/QL AD/FD diagnostics, and no
       production nonlinear claim. The alpha-heldout and surface-heldout
       splits pass as reduced generalization evidence, Li383 passes as a
       second-equilibrium aggregate finite-difference/line-search check, and
       the QH held-out transport artifact closes the VMEC/Boozer aggregate
       promotion gate. The separate production nonlinear optimization guard now
       includes long-window D-shaped, circular, and QH VMEC/Boozer holdouts plus
       one selected optimized-equilibrium seed/timestep audit; production
       promotion remains blocked until three independent optimized-equilibrium
       ensembles and three matched audits pass. Broader nonlinear turbulence
       gradients and multi-surface transport optimization are still separate
       gates.

       readiness
     - ``docs/_static/nonlinear_gradient_ql_seed_screen.json`` and

       launch-plan and measured-response artifacts are tracked in
       ``docs/_static/nonlinear_gradient_state_to_input_mapping_campaign.json``
       and
       ``docs/_static/nonlinear_gradient_state_to_input_mapping_response.json``,
       plus the symmetry-compatible

       and
       ``docs/_static/nonlinear_gradient_asymmetric_state_to_input_mapping_response.json``
     - Closed for checked short-bracket launch mapping; nonlinear evidence still open
     - the QL seed screen admits ``Rsin_mid_surface_m1`` and
       ``Zcos_mid_surface_m1`` as state controls. The measured ``RBC/ZBS``
       response matrix has rank ``0`` and relative target residual ``1`` for
       both controls, but the measured ``LASYM=true`` ``RBS/ZBC`` response has
       rank ``2`` with condition number about ``1.02`` and residuals near
       machine precision. The runbook now emits explicit least-squares input
       directions for checked short-bracket launches; converged long-window
       nonlinear-gradient campaigns remain the next evidence gate
   * - VMEC-state short-bracket launch status
     - mapped state-control VMEC launch decks and bounded nonlinear campaign
       manifests

       and
       ``docs/_static/nonlinear_gradient_state_control_short_bracket_launch_status.json``
     - Closed as launch readiness; nonlinear-gradient evidence still open
     - the two mapped state controls are converted to explicit ``LASYM=true``
       ``RBS/ZBC`` input directions with absolute ``1e-3`` scalar steps. All
       six baseline/plus/minus VMEC solves terminate normally, and two bounded
       ``t=150`` nonlinear campaign manifests are prepared. This is not a
       transport-gradient claim until those nonlinear campaigns pass runtime,
       replicated-window, central-FD, and evidence gates
   * - VMEC-state short-bracket nonlinear audit
     - bounded nonlinear runtime outputs, replicated windows, and central-FD
       promotion blockers for mapped state controls
     - ``docs/_static/nonlinear_gradient_state_control_short_bracket_nonlinear_audit_status.json``
       plus the two ``qa_lowres_state_control_short_bracket_*_central_fd_gradient_gate.json``
       artifacts and their replicated-window sidecars
     - Closed as negative short-bracket evidence; production gradient still open
     - all ``18`` office GPU nonlinear runs complete. The six corrected
       runtime-output groups and six replicated-window ensemble groups pass,
       with heat-flux means near ``10``. Both central-FD gates fail closed:
       the ``Rsin`` response fraction is about ``0.0045`` with asymmetry
       about ``9.5`` and uncertainty about ``7.7``; the ``Zcos`` response
       fraction is about ``0.0015`` with asymmetry about ``45`` and
       uncertainty about ``23``. A bracket-amplitude sweep or longer/lower-noise
       window is required before promotion
   * - VMEC-state bracket-amplitude sweep
     - bounded nonlinear outputs, replicated windows, and central-FD promotion
       blockers for mapped controls at larger single-control amplitudes
     - ``docs/_static/nonlinear_gradient_state_control_bracket_sweep_status.json``
       plus the four ``qa_lowres_alpha0p*_state_control_short_bracket_*_central_fd_gradient_gate.json``
       artifacts and their replicated-window sidecars
     - Closed as negative single-control bracket evidence; production gradient
       still open
     - all ``36`` office GPU nonlinear runs at ``alpha_delta=3e-3`` and
       ``1e-2`` complete with no runtime failures. Output and replicated-window
       gates remain stable, but all four central-FD gates fail. The best
       response fraction is about ``0.0045`` against the ``0.03`` gate, so the
       next test must reduce variance or change the observable/control basis
   * - Selected optimized-equilibrium nonlinear transport audit
     - optimized-equilibrium post-transient heat-flux average with uncertainty
       and nonlinear audit bars
     - ``docs/_static/optimized_equilibrium_replicates/optimized_equilibrium_replicate_t700_ensemble_gate.json``
       and ``docs/_static/production_nonlinear_optimization_guard.json``
     - Closed for selected optimized-equilibrium replicated transport audit
     - the selected QA optimized equilibrium passes the ``t=[350,700]`` seed
       and timestep ensemble gate; nonlinear turbulence-gradient and broad
       multi-surface/multi-field-line optimization claims remain open
   * - QA/ESS ``ZBS(1,0)`` 7.5% nonlinear-gradient follow-up
     - matched baseline/plus/minus post-transient heat-flux windows and central
       finite-difference response
     - ``docs/_static/qa_ess_zbs10_rel7p5_nonlinear_gradient_zbs_1_0_central_fd_gradient_gate.json``
       plus the three replicated ensemble sidecar directories and
       ``docs/_static/qa_ess_zbs10_rel7p5_variance_reduction_plan.json``
     - Closed as negative bounded-gradient evidence; production gradient still open
     - all twelve ``t=900`` office-GPU outputs pass the ``t=[450,900]`` output
       gates, and the central finite-difference response is resolved and local
       (``response_fraction = 0.0319``, ``fd_asymmetry_rel = 0.044``). The
       plus ensemble fails its spread gate (``0.196 > 0.15``), and propagated
       uncertainty remains too large (``gradient_uncertainty_rel = 1.81``), so
       the result is not promoted. The paired-seed runbook also fails closed:
       common-label plus-minus differences have relative uncertainty about
       ``0.984``. A midpoint common-mode control variate lowers apparent
       residual uncertainty to ``0.238`` but is blocked because the control
       mean is not independently known, motivating an independent control-mean
       estimate or a better-conditioned observable. The pre-run launch
       contract estimates ``21`` independent control-mean pairs, ``42`` new
       nonlinear runs, and projected combined uncertainty ``0.480``. The
       follow-up office campaign now completes those ``21`` matched pairs and
       passes the strict ``t=[600,1100]`` control-mean gate with combined
       response uncertainty ``0.311 < 0.5``, plus spread ``0.1268``, minus
       spread ``0.1193``, and no failed per-seed window rows.

Use this section as the verification boundary for README figures: the
VMEC/Boozer parity, gradient-holdout, and reduced optimization/UQ panels can be
cited as reduced objective evidence. Startup-window finite-difference panels
and reduced nonlinear-window estimators must not be cited as saturated
transport-gradient validation. The optimized-equilibrium replicate panel may be
cited as a post-transient transport-window audit for the selected candidate,
not as a universal quasilinear absolute-flux model.

Parallelization Validation
--------------------------

Independent ``k_y`` and ensemble parallelization is accepted only when a
serial numerical-identity gate accompanies the timing data. The current closed
artifact is ``docs/_static/parallel_ky_scan_gate.png`` with metadata in
``docs/_static/parallel_ky_scan_gate.json``. It runs the real Cyclone linear
solver with ``ky_batch=1`` and a fixed-shape batched scan, then requires
``max_gamma_rel_error <= 1e-8`` and ``max_omega_abs_error <= 1e-8``. The
observed speedup is reported as an engineering metric, not as the gate itself.
The larger CPU/GPU strong-scaling artifacts
``docs/_static/independent_ky_scan_scaling_large.json`` and
``docs/_static/quasilinear_uq_ensemble_scaling_large.json`` are the current
release references for production independent-work scaling. Their split CPU
and GPU companions must keep per-row identity, timing, and worker/profile
metadata synchronized with the performance and validation manifests.
``docs/_static/parallelization_completion_status.json`` is the release ledger
that turns those artifacts into a scoped production-closure claim while keeping
nonlinear domain-decomposition speedup out of scope.
Fixed-step nonlinear full-state sharding now has an engineering identity
artifact at ``docs/_static/nonlinear_sharding_profile.json`` generated by
``tools/profile_nonlinear_sharding.py``. That closes the control-flow and
final-state identity layer for the pjit state-sharded scan. The corresponding
two-GPU office artifact,
``docs/_static/nonlinear_sharding_profile_office_gpu.json``, confirms active
``auto``/``kx`` sharding with zero final-state error on the bounded profiling
grid. The large combined sweep
``docs/_static/nonlinear_sharding_strong_scaling_large.json`` is a
profiler/identity artifact, not a production nonlinear speedup claim. The same
diagnostic keeps ``z``-axis FFT sharding out of the release claim until it has
a dedicated communication/layout design and a passing identity gate. True
nonlinear domain decomposition with halo/FFT communication, conservation
checks, and benchmark-size speedup remains outside the release claim.

Notes
-----

- A lane should not move from ``Open`` to ``Closed`` without an owning script,
  frozen artifact path, and literature/reference statement.
- README figures should use only ``Closed`` lanes unless a panel is explicitly
  marked exploratory.
- Raw eigenfunction overlays for manuscript use should be rendered only from
  frozen reference bundles checked into ``docs/_static/reference_modes/``.
  Do not build publication figures from transient external files or ad hoc
  office-machine outputs.
- Experimental-facing figures such as W7-X fluctuation spectra should remain
  scoped as simulation diagnostics unless the diagnostic transfer function and
  access model are encoded directly in the repo.
- Electromagnetic stellarator claims should be split explicitly into
  heavy-electron verification and realistic-electron research runs.
