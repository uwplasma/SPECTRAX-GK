Performance
===========

JAX performance model
---------------------

SPECTRAX-GK uses JAX to compile array kernels ahead of time, enabling
vectorized, accelerator-ready performance while retaining automatic
differentiation. The linear operator and time integrator are designed to be
``jit``-friendly and to avoid Python-side loops in performance-critical paths.

The linear solver precomputes geometry-dependent arrays (gyroaverage
coefficients, drift frequency, and zero-mode masks) in a ``LinearCache`` to
avoid recomputing them at each time step. This cache is reused inside the JIT
compiled integrator.

Planned optimizations
---------------------

- ``vmap`` over species and parameter scans
- ``pjit``/sharding for multi-device acceleration
- FFT acceleration and layout tuning
- operator fusion for nonlinear terms
