Time integration
----------------

The linear solver supports explicit Euler, RK2, and RK4 updates inside a JAX
``scan`` loop, enabling JIT compilation and differentiability of the entire time
history. The time integrator lives in ``gkx.solvers.linear.integrators.integrate_linear`` and
is configured via the ``method`` argument. RK4 is used in the Cyclone harness.

To stabilize higher-order Hermite-Laguerre scans, two additional options are
available:

- ``method="imex"``: a semi-implicit update that treats Lenard-Bernstein and
  hyper-diffusion damping implicitly while keeping the drift/streaming terms
  explicit.
- ``method="implicit"``: a backward-Euler solve using a matrix-free GMRES
  iteration provided by SOLVAX. This is slower but robust for stiff linear runs.
  The same shared policy is used by nonlinear IMEX time steps. A few stabilized
  fixed-point sub-iterations provide an initial guess and a diagonal
  preconditioner based on the damping terms and drift/mirror diagonals
  (cv/gb/bgrad) accelerates convergence for higher-order scans. For
  streaming-dominated stiffness, ``implicit_preconditioner="hermite-line"``
  applies a Hermite streaming line solve (tridiagonal in ``m`` at fixed
  :math:`k_z`) and can substantially reduce GMRES iterations. The reusable
  tridiagonal algebra is provided by SOLVAX; GKX constructs the
  gyrokinetic coefficients and linked-chain layout. CPU execution uses a
  deterministic Thomas recurrence, while accelerator execution uses the fused
  backend selected by SOLVAX.

Implicit time stepping has one supported complex unitary-Givens FGMRES
algorithm. Users configure its tolerance, restart length, iteration limit,
and physical preconditioner rather than selecting equivalent backend aliases.
Shift-invert eigenmode extraction is separate and is not yet migrated because
its branch-continuity gate remains open. Complex Ritz vectors now use the
mathematically correct ``V @ y`` reconstruction. Arnoldi directions smaller
than a dtype-scaled operator threshold are treated as numerical breakdown
rather than normalized roundoff. Preconditioned shifted solves are also checked
against the original physical linear system and retried without the
preconditioner if that residual is not converged. An outer eigenpair-residual
gate then rejects both primary and fallback pairs. These corrections reduce a
representative reduced shifted-solve residual from ``4.76`` to ``1.14e-5`` and
recover its dense-reference mode with residual ``3.18e-6``. The full canonical
KBM audit now reports outer residual ``0.936`` against the ``0.1`` threshold
after preserving the preconditioned iterate as the unpreconditioned retry seed,
so this lane remains unpromoted rather than silently returning that branch;
validated time integration remains the release path.

Two bounded full-resolution refinements were also rejected. Re-projecting the
physical operator onto the shift-focused Arnoldi basis returned a non-finite
pair and increased peak resident memory from about ``0.87`` to ``1.18`` GB.
Starting the unpreconditioned inner retry from zero likewise returned a
non-finite pair without reducing the roughly ``133`` second CPU runtime. The
released implementation therefore retains the finite fail-closed baseline;
future work requires a branch-preserving thick restart or field-coupled complex
preconditioner with a lower physical residual, not another tolerance sweep.

A bounded full-operator defect-correction preconditioner lowered the same
full-resolution residual to ``0.330``, but a second explicit restart returned
``0.326`` and therefore added cost without canonical-grid convergence. The
candidate was removed. A future revisit should use retained-subspace
Krylov--Schur with harmonic extraction for this interior mode and must pass the
same physical residual, branch-identity, memory, and runtime gates before it
can replace time integration.

Three subsequent reduced-operator discriminators further narrow that work.
An exact projected Jacobi--Davidson step solved its correction equation to
relative residual ``0.035`` but worsened the physical eigenpair residual from
``0.742`` to ``0.876``. Ordered complex-Schur compression retaining four
vectors selected a damped branch, worsened ``0.755`` to ``0.956``, and cost
about ``61`` seconds per restart. Seeding shift-invert from a short propagator
lowered the residual to ``0.521`` but also selected the wrong damped branch.
No implementation was retained. A release candidate must instead demonstrate
a branch-preserving two-sided or field-coupled low-moment correction on the
physical operator, not only convergence of its inner projected equation.
A bounded A4000 run at ``Nl=8,Nm=24`` likewise reached residual ``0.429`` only
after moving to the wrong high-frequency branch, so the negative result is not
confined to the smallest CPU case.

A two-sided correction did not repair the problem: the left inverse iterations
remained unconverged and the first well-solved projected equation moved to a
different branch with residual ``0.870``. A matrix-free field-coupled
low-moment preconditioner was also rejected because it took ``240`` seconds
versus ``30`` seconds for the damping baseline and returned residual ``0.972``
on the wrong branch. Any future field-coupled candidate must use an explicitly
reduced Schur block; nesting a full-operator solve is neither accurate nor
competitive.

An explicitly assembled field/moment block confirmed that the remaining
problem is the complement, not block construction. The ``1536 x 1536`` complex
coarse matrix assembled in ``0.49`` seconds, factored in ``0.15`` seconds, and
used ``36`` MiB. Coupling it to either a diagonal or full Hermite-line
high-moment smoother nevertheless selected incorrect branches with residuals
``0.936`` and ``0.999``; both complete solves took about ``55`` seconds and
exceeded ``1.3`` GB resident memory. These variants were removed. The release
continues to use validated time integration for KBM, while a future direct
interior spectral transformation must establish branch identity before it can
be considered an acceleration.

The generic inner solve is intentionally not migrated to SOLVAX yet. A matched
SOLVAX 0.7.3 FGMRES probe at reduced ``Nl=8,Nm=24`` resolution selected a
damped ``-2.1301+0.8333i`` eigenvalue with physical residual ``0.912``, compared
with ``0.584`` for the current JAX GMRES route. SOLVAX remains the owner of the
admitted implicit linear and nonlinear solves; shift-invert migration requires
both lower residual and identical KBM branch selection.

Acceptance also follows the requested spectral selection. Growth-selected
searches enforce ``fallback_real_floor``; nearest-shift, overlap, and explicit
shift searches may intentionally select a stable mode and therefore use
finiteness plus the physical outer residual instead. Rejection messages identify
which of the non-finite, growth-floor, or residual criteria failed.

Optional damping
----------------

To stabilize high-order Hermite-Laguerre moments, the linear operator supports
two damping models:

- A Lenard-Bernstein diagonal rate ``nu`` with coefficients
  :math:`\nu(\alpha m + \beta l)`.
- Hyper-collisions in velocity space with coefficients ``nu_hyper_l``,
  ``nu_hyper_m``, and ``nu_hyper_lm`` and exponents ``p_hyper_l``,
  ``p_hyper_m``, ``p_hyper_lm``. These damp the highest Hermite/Laguerre
  indices and are enabled by default for Cyclone-style scans.
- Smooth end-cap damping in the field-aligned direction controlled by
  ``damp_ends_widthfrac`` and ``damp_ends_amp`` to suppress reflections at
  linked boundaries.

Both can be disabled or tuned via ``LinearParams`` for resolution studies.

Performance caching
-------------------

To reduce repeated geometry work inside the time loop, we cache the gyroaverage
coefficients, drift frequency, and zero-mode mask in a ``LinearCache`` object.
The helper ``build_linear_cache`` constructs this cache, and
``integrate_linear`` will build and reuse it automatically.

Growth rate extraction
----------------------

Given a complex mode time series

.. math::

   \phi(t) \approx \exp[(\gamma - i \omega) t],

we estimate :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\omega` by least-squares fits of
:math:`\log|\phi|` and the unwrapped phase versus time. The helper
``fit_growth_rate_auto`` can automatically select a fitting window by scanning
for the most exponential-like segment of the time history, reducing sensitivity
to early transients in ky scans. This method is used in the Cyclone linear
benchmark harness when ``auto_window=True``.
