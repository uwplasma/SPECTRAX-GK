SPECTRAX-GK is a JAX-native gyrokinetic solver designed for differentiability, 
high-performance accelerator execution, and advanced stellarator optimization. 
The code employs a Hermite-Laguerre velocity space, Fourier perpendicular 
coordinates, and field-aligned flux-tube geometry to simulate linear and 
nonlinear electrostatic and electromagnetic turbulence in magnetized plasmas.

## Installation

```bash
pip install spectraxgk
```

or install the development checkout directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uwplasma/SPECTRAX-GK
cd SPECTRAX-GK
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart (Executable)

```bash
# Run the built-in default example.
spectraxgk

# The hyphenated entry point works too.
spectrax-gk

# Run directly from a checked-in TOML.
spectraxgk examples/linear/axisymmetric/cyclone.toml

# Write a restartable nonlinear NetCDF bundle.
spectraxgk run-runtime-nonlinear \
  --config examples/nonlinear/axisymmetric/runtime_cyclone_nonlinear.toml \
  --steps 200 \
  --out tools_out/cyclone_release.out.nc

# Point the same config at a different VMEC equilibrium without editing the TOML.
spectrax-gk run \
  --config examples/nonlinear/non-axisymmetric/runtime_hsx_nonlinear_vmec_geometry.toml \
  --vmec-file /path/to/wout_HSX_QHS_vacuum_ns201.nc \
  --out tools_out/hsx_run

# Turn any saved runtime bundle into a polished figure.
spectraxgk --plot tools_out/cyclone_release.out.nc
spectraxgk --plot tools_out/spectraxgk_default_linear.summary.json
```

Running `spectraxgk` with no TOML starts the default Cyclone linear example
(equivalent to the standard `examples/linear/axisymmetric/cyclone.toml`
surface), prints the fitted growth rate and frequency to the terminal, and
writes a two-panel figure to `tools_out/spectraxgk_default_linear.png`. The
left panel shows the linear `|\phi|^2` history on a log scale with the fitted
`(\gamma, \omega)` annotation. The right panel shows the normalized real and
imaginary eigenfunction.

The `--plot` mode reads saved runtime artifacts directly:

- linear bundles: `*.summary.json` + `*.timeseries.csv` + `*.eigenfunction.csv`
- nonlinear bundles: `*.summary.json` + `*.diagnostics.csv` or `*.out.nc`

Linear plots reproduce the two-panel growth/eigenfunction layout. Nonlinear
plots produce a three-panel diagnostic view with field amplitude/energy,
resolved diagnostics, and heat flux.

## Highlights

- **Differentiable JAX-native kernels** for gradient-based optimization and sensitivity analysis.
- **Hermite-Laguerre spectral velocity basis** providing efficient kinetic closures and multi-fidelity modeling.
- **Accelerator-ready execution** on CPUs and GPUs with JIT compilation.
- **Flexible geometry interface** supporting analytic s-alpha, Miller, and direct VMEC equilibrium imports.
- **Electromagnetic turbulence** including $(\phi, A_\parallel, B_\parallel)$ fluctuations.
- **Multi-species support** with kinetic electrons and advanced collision operators.
- **Automated benchmark workflows** for reproducible validation and regression tracking.

![SPECTRAX-GK nonlinear benchmark panel](docs/_static/benchmark_core_nonlinear_atlas.png)

The figures above represent the validated benchmark suite, covering linear
microinstabilities and nonlinear transport across diverse magnetic
configurations. The shipped nonlinear atlas emphasizes the longest archived
windows currently tracked in the repo: KBM to about `t=400`, W7-X to about
`t=200`, and Cyclone Miller to about `t=122`. HSX is currently archived on the
closed `t=50` window; I did not find a longer HSX nonlinear audit artifact to
promote above that.

Autodiff validation (inverse/sensitivity demo):

![SPECTRAX-GK autodiff inverse demo](docs/_static/autodiff_inverse_growth.png)

This single-mode figure checks that the JAX derivatives are correct and shows how one measured mode constrains the gradients locally. The expected outcome is small observable and Jacobian errors, not exact parameter recovery; the shipped result is a near-perfect match in `(γ, ω)` but a visibly non-unique recovered `(R/L_Ti, R/L_n)` pair.

Autodiff validation (two-mode inverse demo):

![SPECTRAX-GK autodiff two-mode demo](docs/_static/autodiff_inverse_twomode.png)

This two-mode figure is the actual parameter-recovery validation, where the goal is to recover the planted gradients from two independent mode observables. The shipped result reaches the target to numerical precision and the autodiff Jacobian matches finite differences, which is the behavior expected from an identifiable inverse problem.

Single-point runtime TOMLs can also carry their own artifact prefix:

```toml
[output]
path = "tools_out/runtime_case"
```

The executable `--out` flag overrides the TOML value when both are present.

The shipped nonlinear W7-X and HSX runtime TOMLs already set this lightweight
artifact prefix, so long stellarator parity runs leave ``tools_out/...``
diagnostics and summaries behind without extra command-line flags. The direct Python
case wrappers now honor that TOML output contract as well, so chunked
nonlinear runs persist their evolving diagnostics through the same path.

When the nonlinear target ends in `.out.nc` or another `.nc` suffix,
SPECTRAX-GK writes a restartable NetCDF bundle, compatible with the comparison
tooling, instead of the lightweight JSON/CSV sidecars:

- `case.out.nc`: resolved nonlinear diagnostics and metadata
- `case.big.nc`: final fields and moments in real and spectral layouts
- `case.restart.nc`: restart state for continuation runs

The same runtime input can then resume from the saved restart file by setting
restart controls in the TOML:

```toml
[time]
nstep_restart = 100

[output]
path = "tools_out/cyclone_release.out.nc"
restart_if_exists = true
save_for_restart = true
append_on_restart = true
restart_with_perturb = false
```

With that configuration, rerunning the same command resumes from
`tools_out/cyclone_release.restart.nc` when it already exists and appends the
new samples to `tools_out/cyclone_release.out.nc`.

## Quickstart (Python)

```python
from spectraxgk import CycloneBaseCase, LinearParams, integrate_linear_from_config
from spectraxgk.geometry import SAlphaGeometry
from spectraxgk.grids import build_spectral_grid
import jax.numpy as jnp

cfg = CycloneBaseCase()
grid = build_spectral_grid(cfg.grid)
geom = SAlphaGeometry.from_config(cfg.geometry)
params = LinearParams()

G0 = jnp.zeros((2, 2, grid.ky.size, grid.kx.size, grid.z.size), dtype=jnp.complex64)
G0 = G0.at[0, 0, 0, 0, :].set(1.0e-3 + 0.0j)

G_t, phi_t = integrate_linear_from_config(G0, grid, geom, params, cfg.time)
```

## Autodiff demo and parallelization notes

The autodiff inverse/sensitivity example lives at
`examples/theory_and_demos/autodiff_inverse_growth.py` and generates the
figure shown above. It uses JAX autodiff on a short linear ITG window, reports
gradients against a finite-difference check, and writes a summary JSON plus
parameter sweeps for both `R/L_Ti` and `R/L_n` alongside the plot. The
single-mode panel should be read as a local inverse demo, not as a global
identifiability claim; in the shipped figure the observable errors are small
while the parameter errors remain finite for exactly that reason.
The two-mode inverse example in
`examples/theory_and_demos/autodiff_inverse_twomode.py` uses two ky modes to
stabilize the inverse problem and provides the release-grade parameter
recovery panel, closing the identifiability gap present in the single-mode
demo.

For distributed parallelization, set `TimeConfig.state_sharding = "auto"` (or
`"ky"`) in runtime TOMLs to partition the packed state array across available
JAX devices. This path is supported by the diffrax integrators; when only one
device is available the run falls back to single-device execution.

## Benchmarks

SPECTRAX-GK is rigorously validated against standard gyrokinetic benchmarks, including:
- **Linear growth rates and frequencies:** Cyclone ITG, ETG, KBM, W7-X, HSX, Miller, and KAW.
- **Nonlinear transport:** Heat flux and energy traces for ITG, KBM, and stellarator configurations.

The benchmark tooling in `tools/` ensures reproducibility and performance tracking.
For the current release pass, the accepted nonlinear validation set is Cyclone,
KBM, W7-X, HSX, Cyclone Miller, and the closed short-window full-GK ETG
nonlinear pilot. TEM and KAW stay outside the active parity claim.

## Runtime and Memory

![Runtime and memory comparison](docs/_static/runtime_memory_benchmark.png)

SPECTRAX-GK is optimized for performance across CPU and GPU backends. The
runtime panel above compares wall-time and peak memory usage for the shipped
benchmark cases. Performance tracking covers:

- **Cyclone ITG** (linear/nonlinear)
- **KBM** and **ETG** configurations
- **W7-X** and **HSX** stellarator geometries
- **Miller** geometry models

Experimental or not-yet-closed lanes such as KAW, TEM, and kinetic-electron
Cyclone are tracked separately and do not appear in the shipped runtime panel.
For the stellarator rows on `office`, the shipped panel uses pre-generated
`*.eik.nc` geometry files rather than on-the-fly VMEC regeneration. The GX
reference rows also run against a consistent local `netcdf-c` / `hdf5`
runtime stack there, because the default `office` stellarator environment
mixed incompatible HDF5 / NetCDF libraries and lacked the VMEC Python helper
dependencies needed for live geometry generation.

Regenerate the runtime figure from collected per-case summaries with:

```bash
python tools/benchmark_runtime_memory.py \
  --summary-glob tools_out/runtime_memory_*linear.json \
  --summary-glob tools_out/runtime_memory_*nonlinear.json

# For a long office sweep, keep going after a failed row and save per-row logs.
python tools/benchmark_runtime_memory.py --continue-on-error --log-dir tools_out/runtime_memory_logs
```

The parallelization scaling figure is kept in the performance docs rather than
the top-level README. The shipped public plot focuses on the release-grade
2-device diffrax speedup curve rather than the exploratory CPU strong-scaling
study.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory is organized by physics and configuration:

- **`linear/`**: Linear microinstability drivers for axisymmetric (Tokamak) and non-axisymmetric (Stellarator) geometries.
- **`nonlinear/`**: Nonlinear turbulence simulations and transport analysis.
- **`benchmarks/`**: Scripts for replicating published benchmark results and parameter scans.
- **`theory_and_demos/`**: Pedagogical examples and demonstrations of the underlying numerical methods.

Parity-facing nonlinear examples now include:

- Cyclone ITG
- KBM
- W7-X
- HSX
- a full-GK ETG nonlinear pilot lane in `examples/nonlinear/axisymmetric/runtime_etg_nonlinear.toml`

The reduced `cETG` example remains available as a separate reduced-model
workflow; it is not the same thing as the full-GK ETG nonlinear lane.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation, including theory, algorithms, and API references, is available in `docs/`.

## Testing

Default `pytest` runs skip integration tests for faster feedback. Use:

```bash
pytest
pytest -m integration
python tools/run_tests_fast.py
```

## Plotting outputs

To visualize nonlinear diagnostics from a ``*.out.nc`` file:

```bash
python examples/utilities/plot_runtime_outputs.py tools_out/cyclone_nonlinear.out.nc \
  --out tools_out/cyclone_nonlinear_diagnostics.png
```
